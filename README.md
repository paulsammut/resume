# Paul Sammut's Resume

I hated having to boot into Windows just to update my resume and save to some
new file labeled **new_resume_for_Y_company_todays_date.docx**. 

So using Latex in Vim sounded so much better and fun! 

It was really painful setting everything up and tweaking things, but once I did,
having a version controlled resume with automatic PDF gen on every change and
being able to do it in Vim is really really awesome.

This resume is based on Byungjin Park's awesome Awesome-CV. Thanks bud!
