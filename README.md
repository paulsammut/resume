# Paul Sammut's Resume

I hated having to boot into Windows just to update my resume and save to some
new file labeled new_resume_for_Y_company_todays_date.docx. So using Latex in
ViM sounded so much better and fun! This resume is based on Byungjin Park's
awesome Awsome-CV, and solely my personal resume. Thanks bud!

It was really painful setting everything up and tweaking things to my liking,
but once I did, having an version controlled resume with automic PDF gen on
every change and being able to do it in Vim is really really awesome.

Here's my latest resume build:
